This project is a kaggle contest: predicting the stock price with previous market data and news data.

How we did it:
    First, analyzed the market data and news data, eliminated the null value. 
    Second, chose a subset of the initial data set.
    Third, combined the market data and news data.
    Train some machine learning model on the training dataset.
    Evaluate the model on the evaluation dataset.
