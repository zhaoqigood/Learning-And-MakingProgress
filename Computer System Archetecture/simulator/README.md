We implement two simulators: general purpose simulator, pipeline simulator.


The general pupose simulator can execute all the Instructions, but it can not achieve pipeline.


The pipeline simulator can demonstrate how pipeline works, but it can not achieve Transfer instruction and highly-dependendcy instructions.
