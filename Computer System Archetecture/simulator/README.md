We implement two simulators: general purpose simulator, pipeline simulator.


The general pupose simulator can execute all the Instructions, but it can not achieve pipeline.


The pipeline simulator can demonstrate how pipeline works, but it can not achieve Transfer instruction and highly-dependendcy instructions.


As you can see, the two files contains general purpose simulator project and the pipeline simulator respectively.
